# Master thesis
My master's graduation work is dedicated to processing of experimental data. The main goal of the research was to use the developed mathematical algorithm to visualize fine 
structural features of a metal alloy, which have a critical impact on its mechanical properties. The data was collected at the "Prometheus" research institute from an electron 
microscope. It contained data about points where the scan was made (cartesian coordinates and Euler angles, defining the rotation of the material element). 
Subsequently I preprocced the data and applied the algorithm which performed discrete differentiation at each scan point. The resulting structure was visualized. 
All code snippets have been written in Matlab. The research was published and it is now used in related tasks by researchers from "Prometheus" institute.
