| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Air quality | In this project we have a dataset which contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data was recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. The task is to predict the value of target variable C6H6(GT) based on the information about features. So, it is a ***regression*** task. The project contains ***exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation***, implementing ***Linear Regression*** model and ***regularized regression*** models as well. In order to evaluate quality of models were used ***RMSE, R^2 and MAE metrics***. |
| Hypothyroid disease | The objective of this research is to design a machine learning algorithm to predict hypothyroid disease. It is a ***classification*** task, so we use ***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*** and ***Logistic Regression*** as base learners. ***Precision, recall, F1*** quality metrics were used to evaluate the models. Various techniques were adopted to preprocess the data to suite the requirement of analysis. ***Feature selections*** were made to optimize the performance of machine learning algorithms. However, better feature selection techniques can be applied to further improve the accuracy.|
