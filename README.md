| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Air quality | In this project we have a dataset which contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. The task is to predict the value of target variable C6H6(GT) based on the information about features. So, it is a regression task. The project contains exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation, implementing Linear Gegression model and regularized regression methods as well. In order to evaluate quality of models were used RMSE, R^2 and MAE metrics. |
