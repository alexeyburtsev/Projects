| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Air quality | In this project we have a dataset which contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data was recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. The task is to predict the value of target variable C6H6(GT) based on the information about features. So, it is a _regression_ task. The project contains _exploratory data analysis (EDA)_, _data preparation_, implementing _Linear Regression_ model and _regularized regression_ models as well. In order to evaluate quality of models were used _RMSE, R^2 and MAE metrics_. |
