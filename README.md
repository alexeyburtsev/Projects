| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Diploma | My master's graduation work is dedicated to ***processing of experimental data***. The main goal of the research was to use the developed ***mathematical algorithm*** to visualize fine structural features of a metal alloy, which have a critical impact on its mechanical properties. The data was collected at the "Prometheus" research institute from an electron microscope. It contained information about points where the scan was made (cartesian coordinates and Euler angles, defining the rotation of the material element). Subsequently I preprocced the data and applied the algorithm which performed discrete differentiation at each scan point. The resulting structure was visualized. All code snippets have been written in ***Matlab***. The research was published and it is now used in related tasks by researchers from "Prometheus" institute. |
| Air quality | This survey includes the dataset which contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data was recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. The task is to predict the value of target variable C6H6(GT) based on the information about features. So, it is a ***regression*** task. The project contains ***exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation***, implementing ***Linear Regression*** model and ***regularized regression*** models as well. In order to evaluate quality of models were used ***RMSE, R^2 and MAE metrics***. |
| Hypothyroid disease | The objective of this research is to design a machine learning algorithm to predict hypothyroid disease. It is a ***classification*** task, so we use ***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*** and ***Logistic Regression*** as base learners. ***Precision, recall, F1*** quality metrics were used to evaluate the models. Various techniques were adopted to preprocess the data to suite the requirement of analysis. ***Feature selections*** were made to optimize the performance of machine learning algorithms. However, better feature selection techniques can be applied to further improve the accuracy.|
| Sentiment classification | This document represents a problem of ***sentiment classification*** for film rewiews on IMDb. The classification is supposed to be binary (positive and negative classes). The data was loaded, preprocessed, vectorized using ***TF_IDF*** method and then tokinized with ***stemming*** and ***lemmatization*** aproaches separtely. Thereafter ***SGDClassifier, LinearSVC and NaiveBayes*** algorithms were implemented. To evaluate the results confusion matrix and ROC curves were plotted. Hyperparameters were tuned to improve the predictive power of models.|
| Monitoring System | Problem Setup: The Client has thousands of events produced by his monitoring system every day. Events are parsed and represented as strings. The Client wants to have a daily report with events summary. The purpose is to provide solution for text ***clustering*** and text summarization problems. After downloading and cleaning text messages from the dataset were tokenized. Afterthat vectorization, scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction processes were chained into pipeline. The results of clustering were visualized. In the second part ***text summarization*** was performed using ***spaCy*** library. |
| Jobs advert parsing | This snippet presents a ***scrapping tool*** which uses ***BeatifulSoup*** library to parse vacancies on the web-site. The script also allows the user to filter out vacancies containig skills with which the user is not familiar with and to save all the collected data to txt file for subsequent use. |
| Snake AI | This project represents a classic snake game, supplemented by reinforcement learning. The game model was written using ***Pygame*** library. The other part responsible for ***reinforcement learning*** was implemented using ***Pytorch*** framework. While computer plays trying to maximize reward, learning curves are plotting in order to track the learning process. |
